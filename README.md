# DS-3001-Scraping-Lab

**Project Overview**

This project scrapes phone sale listings from Craigslist in the Washington, DC area to analyze trends in phone brands, models, and pricing. The goal is to understand which phone brands are most commonly sold and how prices vary across brands and models.

**Data Collection & Processing**

Data was collected from publicly available Craigslist listings and organized into a pandas DataFrame containing the product name, brand, model, and listed price. The data was cleaned to remove incomplete entries and standardize pricing for analysis.

**Methods & Tools**

Web scraping with Python
Data cleaning and analysis using pandas
Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

**Analysis & Visualizations**

The project includes visualizations comparing prices across brands, the number of listings per brand, and the distribution of prices within each brand to highlight market trends in phone sales.

**Limitations & Ethics**

The data reflects asking prices at a single point in time and may not represent final sale prices. Only publicly available data was used, and no personal information was collected.
